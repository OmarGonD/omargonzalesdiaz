```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## useState - Class based


Solo se debe usar useState en componentes basados en clases. Nada m√°s.

```{js}
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class App extends Component {

  state = {
    persons: [
      {name: 'Max', age:28 },
      {name: 'Manu', age:29 },
      {name: 'Stephanie', age:26 }
    ],
    otherstate: 'some other value'
  }

};

```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
